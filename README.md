Averox
=============
Averox is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn.  

Averox supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard annotations), chat, and the screen.  Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, multi-user whiteboards, shared notes, and breakout rooms.  During the session, Averox generates analytics that are visible to moderators in the Learning Analytics Dashboard.

Presenters can record and playback content for later sharing with others.

We designed Averox for online learning, it can be used for many other applications as well.  The educational use cases for Averox are

  * Online tutoring (one-to-one)
  * Flipped classrooms (recording content ahead of your session)
  * Group collaboration (many-to-many)
  * Online classes (one-to-many)
