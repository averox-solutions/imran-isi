# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support Averox through the community forums and through security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.5.x (or earlier)  | :x:    |
| 2.6.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.7.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.0.x   | :x: |

We have released 2.7 to the community and are going to support both 2.6 and 2.7 together for the coming months (while we're actively developing the next release).  Also, Averox 2.5 is now end of life.

As such, we recommend that all administrators deploy 2.7 going forward.  You'll find [many improvements](https://docs.averox.org/2.7/new-features) in this newer version.
